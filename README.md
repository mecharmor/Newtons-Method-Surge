## Newtons Method Surge (internship project)
Our project goal was to create a web app that can quickly output an approximation to the root of a function using Newton’s Method, introduced in our Calculus class. This would allow for users to bypass the tedious work of performing dozens of iterations by hand. This unique program allows users to enter a function and guess, and have the computer work through the iterations before presenting an answer. The difficulties building this program included designing a loop to properly handle the iterations, as well as formatting the graph and web page. We found that a do-while loop for the heart of the math calculations worked well, and allowed for us to control the number of iterations using the exit conditions. The final website also includes a graph to make it easier for users to visualize the function and make a sound initial guess.

## Objectives
* Gain exposure to JavaScript and jQuery.
* Learn new skills and experience the application development cycle.
* Become familiar with languages, programs, and existing libraries.
* Design an efficient, effective, and useful web application.
* Complete an internship with SURGE that focuses on the group experience.

## Libraries Used
* Bootstrap (Used for Styling)
* MathJax  (converts f(x) into “pretty” styled math)
* Algebrite ( Takes derivative using function string)
* JSXGraph (Graphs f(x))
* jQuery (Simplifies JavaScript when working with the DOM)

## Summary
We succeeded in programming a web application that uses Newton’s method to approximate roots. While we met our goal of outputting the iterations of answers, we were also able to add an interactive graph to give a visual aid for users. This experience allowed us to expand our knowledge of programming languages and libraries. We further reinforced our understanding of programming web apps through the process of developing our own.
